# matter frontend

For information about the Matter project as a whole, see [our organization README](https://github.com/matter-luigiz).

For the hosted version of the site, go to [luigiz-matter.tech](https://luigiz-matter.tech).

Our frontend is a React app built using Create-React-App and Typescript. This respository contains the code for that React app,
including the Home, Search, Learn, and Supply pages. 

To run the app for development, simply clone the repository and run npm install followed by npm start. The URLs for the backend (either local or hosted)
can be configured in the .env file.
